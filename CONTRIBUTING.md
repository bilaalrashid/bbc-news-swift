# Contributing Guidelines
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Writing Code
All code changes are submitted using pull requests, which we actively welcome.

All pull requests should be linked to at least one issue. For feature requests, it is recommended that you open an issue and assign it to yourself before starting work. Please try and keep pull requests as small as possible to make review easier - if you want to work on multiple features, multiple pull requests would be preferred where practical.

To submit a change:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Create that pull request!
6. Request a code review from @bilaalrashid.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github Issues
We use GitHub Issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy! If you intend on working on the feature yourself, please assign it to yourself.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
